# scara_plotter
scara parallel arm robot plotter from ESP8266 with 

## version 1
- 2 servos for movement of the two arms and 1 for up/down of whole plattform

### issues
- unstable 
- up/down movement seized often up
- bad pen mount

## version 2
- sturdier construction
- more powerful servos
- improved pen mount and direct up/down control using small servo
- more complex kinematics, since the pen isn't mounted directly on the corner of the parallelogram

### issues
- servo accuracy is quite bad (especially visible when drawing chess board pattern in https://youtu.be/mxgUuI1V4_M)
